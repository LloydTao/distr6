## Downstream dependencies

There is currently one dependency, `mlr3proba`, which I am the maintainer of. This is expected to break after update and will be patched immediately after `distr6` is on CRAN.

## Test Results

There is one new NOTE about package size, I believe this is due to the package now using Rcpp.

## Test environments

* x86_64-apple-darwin17.6 (64-bit), macOS Catalina 10.15.3, R 4.0.0
* Microsoft Windows Server 2019, R Release
* Mac OS X, R Release
* Ubuntu, R Release
