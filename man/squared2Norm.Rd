\title{Squared Probability Density Function 2-Norm}
\usage{
squared2Norm(object, lower = NULL, upper = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{Distribution.}

\item{lower}{lower limit for integration, default is infimum.}

\item{upper}{upper limit for integration, default is supremum.}
}
\description{
The squared 2-norm of the pdf evaluated over the whole support by default or given
limits.
}
\details{
The squared 2-norm of the pdf is defined by
\deqn{\int (f_X(u))^2 du}
where X is the Distribution and \eqn{f_X} is its pdf.
