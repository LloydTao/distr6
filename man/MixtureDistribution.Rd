\title{Mixture Distribution Wrapper}
\description{
Wrapper used to construct a mixture of two or more distributions.
}
\details{
A Mixture Distribution is a weighted combination of two or more distributions such that for
pdf/cdfs of n distribution f_1,...,f_n/F_1,...,F_n and a given weight associated to each distribution,
w_1,...,w_n. The pdf of the mixture distribution M(X1,...,XN), f_M is given by
\deqn{f_M = sum_i (f_i)(w_i)}
and the cdf, F_M is given by
\deqn{F_M = sum_i (F_i)(w_i)}

If weights are given, they should be provided as a vector of numerics summing to one. If NULL,
they are taken to be uniform, i.e. for n distributions, \eqn{w_i = 1/n, \forall i \in [1,n]}.
